        <p> I'm Karol Ariza, a Full Stack developer living in Canary islands. <br /> Love to travel, playing videogames, read, go to the beach, cook, watching movies, meditation and basically everything that keeps my mind busy and this is why I am deeply in love with develop... well, it's a love and hate relationship but we are working in it! ðŸ˜† <br/> Sometime ago I heard someone saying that if you find a job that you can really enjoy, then you will never have to work. And in my long or short travel for the life, I can say that finally I'm where I'm supossed to.
